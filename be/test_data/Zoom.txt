I am unable to install zoom. I got the error ‘You cannot install the app because you do not have the required permissions. Please contact your IT administrator and try again’.
You need to be an owner to add zoom to zluri. Admins cannot do this. This is a limitation from Zoom.

Please note:You need to approve the app for installation from the zoom marketplace

Still the same error?
It also requires the Zoom owner to approve the app for installation from marketplace

How to approve zluri on the market place?
Click 'App Marketplace' under 'Advanced'. Search for 'Zluri'. https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/589776781/9b6e4d916bfd4370b2a62382/Screenshot+2022-09-30+at+6.55.56+PM.png Click approve use of this app.
